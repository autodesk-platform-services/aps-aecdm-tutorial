# AEC Data Model API Tutorial

This is the repo for the first AEC Data Model API tutorial content.

It is based on [just the docs](https://just-the-docs.com) for documentation and the official AEC Data Model API documentation (check it [here](https://aps.autodesk.com/developer/overview/aec-data-model-api))

This tutorial leverages mostly the [Explorer's](https://aecdatamodel-explorer.autodesk.io) in all the steps.

You can check the tutorial at [https://autodesk-platform-services.github.io/aps-aecdm-tutorial/](https://autodesk-platform-services.github.io/aps-aecdm-tutorial/)

Give it a try and let us know your opinion :)
