# AEC Data Model API Tutorial

This is the repo for the first AEC Data Model API tutorial content.

It is based on [just the docs](https://just-the-docs.com) for documentation and the official AEC Data Model API documentation (check it [here](https://aps.autodesk.com/developer/overview/aec-data-model-api))

This tutorial leverages mostly the [Explorer's](https://aecdatamodel-explorer.autodesk.io) in all the steps.

You can check the tutorial at https://joaomartins-callmejohn.github.io/aecdm-api-tutorial/
